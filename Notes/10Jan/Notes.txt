Drawbacks of JDBC: 

1. Moving from One Database to Another Database is quite difficult since we need to 
change the queries.

2. Chances of issues with the query. 


ORM: 

ORM stands for Object Relation Mapping

Tables -> Java Classes 
Columns -> variables 
rows -> objects


Since we are not dealing with database directly, instead we use Java Classes to 
interact with Database, hence shifting from one database to another database is 
just a configuration.

ORM is responsible to provide seamless shift from one database to another 
database with configuration. 

ORM supports in writing queries based on the methods we use. 


Hibernate:

1. Add dependencies to POM.XML 

2. Add the required configuration in hibernate.cfg.xml 

3. Create Model / Entity Classes 

4. Get the Session Factory Object 

5. Open Session, perform the operation and close the session.
