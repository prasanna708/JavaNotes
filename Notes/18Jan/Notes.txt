Caching: 

Cache is a temporary memory where we can store some data. 

Hibernate caching is the process where Hibernate uses a cache to store some data which 
could be accessed by multiple users. instead of making the same query to the 
database multiple times, it access the data from the cache which aviods making multiple 
same calls (queries) to the database.

Hibernate provides 2 types of cache.

1.First Level Cache: 

This is the default cache, which is maintained at session level. which means, 
when the same user requests for the same data, then hibernate fetches that 
data from the cache. 

2. Second Level Cache: 

This is a configuration based cache and it is maintained at session factory level.

Session Factory provides different sessions for different users, hence if any data 
is accessed by some user, it will be cached and if any other user requests for the 
same data, then instead of making a request to DB, Hibernate fetches the data from 
the cache.
